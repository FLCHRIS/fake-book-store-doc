# Fake Book Store Documentation

![screenshot](./public/images/screenshot.png)

Fake Books API is a free online REST API that you can use whenever you need pseudo-real data for your library application, whether for development, testing, or educational purposes. This API provides dummy information about books, authors, and categories with authentication.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
